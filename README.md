Machine Learning
================

A collection of machine-learning projects:

- ___Unsupervised Clustering___ (original research): developed a clustering model by implementing _Spatial Autorcorrelation Analysis_ to detect domains of atomic dopants in graphene.<br>

- ___Recommender System:___  application of 'Content-Based Filtering' and 'Collaborative Filtering' to predict movie ratings based on users' prior ratings.  The models used include _Support Vector Machines_ (SVM), _k-Nearest Neighbors_ (kNN), and _Linear Regression_.<br>

- ___Spam Filter:___  using Naive Bayes to classify emails as ham or spam.<br>
